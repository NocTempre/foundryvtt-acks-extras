# Importer — Design Model

> Merged from the separate acks-importer repo on 2026-09-01. Text written before then names paths as they were there: `scripts/x.mjs` is now `scripts/importer/x.mjs`, `tools/x.mjs` is `tools/importer/x.mjs`, `flags["acks-importer"]` is `flags["acks-extras"]` (the importer's `generated` key is now `minted`), and `acksImporter.fn()` is `acksExtras.importer.fn()`.

How this module applies the family doctrine **reuse → extend → enhance →
invent**:

- **Reuse**: which core `acks` documents, fields, and methods it builds on.
- **Extend**: genuinely new data, stored in `flags["acks-extras"]` (typed by
  an in-memory DataModel where practical; blank numerics are `null`, never 0).
- **Enhance**: alternate sheets, libWrapper wraps, socketlib GM routing.
- **Invent**: kept to nothing the system already provides.
