# Magic — live-test recipe

Format per docs-doctrine: fixtures → steps → observable → teardown. Server and
driver mechanics are `C:\Proj\acks-rules\TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md`. Each release
adds its surface's recipe here before its tag.

## Offline gate

`npm test` runs `tools/test-magic.mjs`: every vocabulary family against the
lang file in both directions, the monsters `USAGE` alias, the importer's
frequency scan, the effect-type domains. Green here proves the tables agree
with each other; it proves nothing about a window.

## The vocabulary (foundation)

The one runtime surface the vocabulary changes before the spell sheet exists
is the frequency select on a monster-owned ability.

### Fixtures

- A disposable `monster` actor created through the driver's ledger
  (`api.create`), holding one `ability` item.

### Steps

1. Open the ability from the monster's sheet; the "ACKS Monster" fieldset the
   monsters feature injects is at the bottom of the item sheet.
   *Observable:* the Usage select lists the thirteen shared frequencies, at
   will first and by caster level last, as English labels; no option reads as
   a raw `ACKS-LIB.enum` key.
2. Pick "Once per three turns" and let the sheet submit.
   *Observable:* `item.getFlag("acks-extras", "usage")` reads `per3Turns`,
   and reopening the sheet shows that option selected.
3. Pick "By caster level (scheduled)", one of the three members the monsters
   table did not have.
   *Observable:* the flag reads `byLevel` and the sheet re-renders without a
   console error.

### Teardown

`api.sweepTracked()`; quote its result. The actor and its ability are the
only documents the run created.
