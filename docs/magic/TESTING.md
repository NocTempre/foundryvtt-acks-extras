# Magic — live-test recipe

Format per docs-doctrine: fixtures → steps → observable → teardown. Server and
driver mechanics are `C:\Proj\acks-rules\TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md`. Each release
adds its surface's recipe here before its tag.

## Offline gate

`npm test` runs `tools/test-magic.mjs`: every vocabulary family against the
lang file in both directions, the monsters `USAGE` alias, the importer's
frequency scan, the effect-type domains. Green here proves the tables agree
with each other; it proves nothing about a window.

## The vocabulary (foundation)

The one runtime surface the vocabulary changes before the spell sheet exists
is the frequency select on a monster-owned ability.

### Fixtures

- A disposable `monster` actor created through the driver's ledger
  (`api.create`), holding one `ability` item.

### Steps

1. Open the ability from the monster's sheet; the "ACKS Monster" fieldset the
   monsters feature injects is at the bottom of the item sheet.
   *Observable:* the Usage select lists the thirteen shared frequencies, at
   will first and by caster level last, as English labels; no option reads as
   a raw `ACKS-LIB.enum` key.
2. Pick "Once per three turns" and let the sheet submit.
   *Observable:* `item.getFlag("acks-extras", "usage")` reads `per3Turns`,
   and reopening the sheet shows that option selected.
3. Pick "By caster level (scheduled)", one of the three members the monsters
   table did not have.
   *Observable:* the flag reads `byLevel` and the sheet re-renders without a
   console error.

### Teardown

`api.sweepTracked()`; quote its result. The actor and its ability are the
only documents the run created.

## The spell primitive and the spell import (1a)

Every step below needs the seat's own RR PDF connected (the *Your ACKS Books
(this seat)* macro); nothing here is a fixture document.

### Fixtures

- One hand-made `spell` Item through the driver's ledger (`api.create`), with
  no flag on it — the sheet's derived strings are checked on this one.
- One disposable `character` actor through the ledger, for the template and
  picker steps. A class whose starting templates print a spellbook must
  already be imported, and imported after the spells — a class packaged
  before they existed keeps printed names on its template, and step 5 reports
  them unresolved; the class is the world's, not the run's.

### Steps

1. As GM, `acksExtras.importer.importSpells()` (the getting-started chain
   runs the same step, *Importing spells…*, before the classes).
   *Observable:* the notification counts the imports; the imported Items
   compendium's *Spells* folder holds one document per printed entry of the
   spell chapter plus the sample rituals; on any of them
   `getFlag("acks-extras", "spell")` carries a non-empty `lists[]`, a `type`,
   a range shape and a duration shape; `system.class` reads the first list's
   label and `system.lvl` its level; `img` is not the grey placeholder. A
   ritual carries `ritual: true`; a spell whose heading printed an asterisk
   carries `reversible: true` and a `reversedName`.
2. Open one imported spell.
   *Observable:* the ACKS Spell sheet, three tabs — Overview with the lists
   and shapes filled, Description with the book text closing on its cite
   link, Mechanics with no rows and the add control — and no console error.
   Open the one whose prose names two damage types with "or" between them:
   both words are present.
3. Open the hand-made spell. On Overview set the range shape to a distance
   with a value and unit, and a duration shape; let the sheet submit.
   *Observable:* `system.range` and `system.duration` now read the strings
   the shapes express; clearing a string and submitting fills it again from
   the flag.
4. Run `importSpells()` a second time.
   *Observable:* nothing imported, every entry already present. Then
   *Reimport One Shelf → Spells → Repair in place*: every document keeps its
   id; a `cast` count you set beforehand survives; an effect row you added on
   Mechanics survives.
5. Apply a spellbook-printing template to the disposable actor through the
   class's Templates tab.
   *Observable:* the named spells land on the actor as spell Items that carry
   the flag (the imported documents, not the core pack's namesakes); the
   printed pick, where the template prints one, is a pending-choice marker,
   and opening it lists each imported spell of the class's tradition once.
6. Join as the player seat that owns the disposable actor and open one of its
   spells.
   *Observable:* the sheet renders with no console error; fields submit for
   the owner and are inert for a seat that does not own the actor.
7. Run the *Uninstall — Strip Spell Data* macro, confirm.
   *Observable:* the notification counts the items stripped; a spell in the
   world's Items directory or on an actor keeps its name, description and
   strings and has no flag. The imported shelf is a world compendium, which
   the strip leaves alone, so its documents still carry theirs. Then
   *Repair in place* on the Spells shelf.
   *Observable:* every document on the shelf replaced in place, ids
   unchanged, a `cast` count and an effect row kept; a copy on an actor
   stays stripped.

### Teardown

`api.sweepTracked()`; quote its result. The imported spells are the seat's
own world content and stay; the hand-made spell and the actor are the only
documents the run created.
