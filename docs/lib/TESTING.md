# Lib — live-test recipe

Format per docs-doctrine: fixtures → steps → observable → teardown. Server and
driver mechanics are `C:\Proj\acks-rules\TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md`.

`lib` is the shared surface every other feature reads, so a break here shows up
as ten features breaking. Walk this recipe before the others when several
report the same symptom.

## Fixtures

- Disposable `acks-extras.animal`, `acks-extras.group` and
  `acks-extras.template` actors.
- A disposable `acks-extras.location` actor (a storage provider).
- A disposable `character` and a `monster` to put inside them.

## Core drive mechanics (non-obvious, learned live)

- **Sub-types need a world relaunch, not an F5** — `.claude/rules/live-testing.md`
  has the whole rule. Check `game.documentTypes.Actor` before concluding a
  model failed to register.
- **`storage.stash(source, provider, spec)` — the place is the SECOND
  argument**, and `spec` is an array of `{id, qty}`, not documents.
  `retrieve(provider, target, spec)` reverses it. Passing documents where a
  spec belongs returns `{ok: false}` with no throw.
- **Coin `cv` is the COPPER value.** A gold piece is `cv: 100`. Minting with
  `cv: 1` produces items that look right on the sheet and are worth a
  hundredth of what the test expects — every downstream spend then reports
  `insufficientGold` and the bug looks like it is in the spender.
- Mint coin with `money.creditCoin(holder, [{name, cv, count}])` — an ARRAY.
  A bare object is not iterable and throws `credits is not iterable`.
- Hand-creating a `money` item instead is not equivalent: `coinSlots` reads
  `system.coppervalue`, which `creditCoin` sets and a hand-made item does not.
- **A storage round-trip RE-CREATES the item, so a remembered item id is stale
  afterwards.** `stash` then `retrieve` returns an item with a new `_id`;
  `actor.items.get(oldId)` is undefined and every call taking that item then
  reports "missing". Re-fetch by name after any transfer.
- **A group's occupants are `system.stacks`, not a count**, and they are added
  by DROPPING an actor on the group sheet.
- `bracketRow(rows, value)` returns **null** off the end of a table rather
  than clamping to the last row. Every ladder in the family reads through it,
  so assert the null.

### Driving an initiative roll

- **Core's speaker reads `canvas.scene._id`**, so a scene must be VIEWED and the
  canvas ready or `rollInitiative` throws on null before rolling anything. The
  canvas never finishes initializing in a backgrounded browser pane — drive this
  one through the capture driver's browser.
- **Start the combat first.** Core writes flags to every combatant mid-roll
  (`processOutNumbering`, `cleanupStatus`) while its own `lock-turns` flag makes
  `setupTurns()` bail, and on a combat that was never started that update throws
  inside `foundry.mjs` (`#recordPreviousState`, Object.assign on undefined). It
  reads as a module bug and is not one.
- **An aborted roll leaves `lock-turns` set**, and every later combatant write on
  that combat throws the same way. Clear it and `setupTurns()` before retrying,
  or the next check fails for the reason the last one did.
- **Core mutates the group flag object in memory as it rolls** (`initiative` goes
  from `-1` to the rolled total) and never writes it back. Within one client a
  second roll therefore finds the group already rolled, prints nothing, and the
  card correctly does not post — reset the flag between rolls.
- Form a group the way the tracker does: `combat.manageGroup([tokenDoc, …])`,
  two tokens minimum, both already combatants.

## Steps

1. Sub-types: create one actor of each lib type.
   *Observable:* `game.documentTypes.Actor` lists all three, each creates, and
   each opens its own sheet (`GroupSheet`, `TemplateSheet`; an animal opens
   the monsters feature's `FullMonsterSheet`).
2. Groups: drop a monster on the group sheet.
   *Observable:* a stack row appears naming it, with a headcount and the
   Individuate / Record casualties controls; `system.stacks` holds it.
3. Templates: import a table into the template and materialize it.
   *Observable:* the sheet stops saying it has no materialized tables and
   generates a document from them.
4. Storage: `stash(character, location, [{id, qty}])` then
   `retrieve(location, character, [{id, qty}])`.
   *Observable:* both return `{ok: true}` with a manifest; the item moves off
   the character's sheet and back, and `storedItems(location)` tracks it.
   `ownerOf` returns the stamping actor on the way in and attribution is
   dropped on the way out.
5. Money: `creditCoin(actor, [{name: "Gold", cv: 100, count: 500}])`, then
   `planCoinSpend` for an amount needing change.
   *Observable:* `coinSlots` reports `cv: 100, qty: 500`; the plan takes
   smallest-first and books the overshoot as change, and a spend it cannot
   cover plans nothing rather than part-paying.
6. Tables: `tables.registerTable({id, rows}, {source})` a ladder — the
   document must carry its own `id` or registration throws — read it with
   `bracketRow` inside and outside its bands, then
   `unregisterTable(id, source)`.
   *Observable:* in-band rows resolve, out-of-band returns null, and the
   deregistered table is gone from `hasDoc`.
7. Attack patch: with the `attackRollPatch` setting on, roll an attack.
   *Observable:* the patched path runs; turn the setting off and the system's
   own path returns. An inert setting is a bug.
8. Vision and senses: with `manageVision` on, place a token of an actor with a
   declared lightless range.
   *Observable:* the token's vision matches `senses.sightRange`, and the
   "Migrate Token Vision" macro re-derives it for tokens already placed.
9. Follower card: open a plain `monster`.
   *Observable:* `FollowerCardSheet` renders as the compact card, and its
   **Full sheet** control (`data-action="fcOpenFull"`) opens `FullMonsterSheet`
   beside it.
10. The imported library, in a world that has imported classes with
    acks-importer 3.0.0 — so the library is in a pack and `game.items` is empty
    of it.
    *Observable:* `acksExtras.lib.library.libraryItems().length` exceeds
    `game.items.size`; the class list on a character's Class tab is populated;
    an imported ability's sheet shows relation NAMES, not raw `def.*` ids; a
    language granted by a class resolves to a document. Each of these read
    `game.items` before and rendered blank.
11. Template generation destination: open an imported template actor and press
    Generate.
    *Observable:* the new actor is in a top-level **Generated** folder in the
    Actors sidebar — never the template's own folder, and never a pack.

12. Initiative card: a scene with six tokens in a started combat — three in one
    combat group, two in a second (one of them hidden), one ungrouped — then
    `combat.rollInitiative(everyId)`.
    *Observable:* ONE public card, each group a single row named `Group 0` /
    `Group 1` listing its members, the ungrouped combatant its own row, sorted
    highest first, Name and Total only (no empty Result column); plus a
    Judges-only card carrying the hidden combatant's row, whispered to the GM
    seats. Join as **Player** and confirm the public card is visible and the
    Judges' card is not (`message.visible === false`). Turn `initiativeCard` off
    and roll again: core's one message per roller is back, unchanged. Rolling a
    single combatant posts a one-row card. No console errors on any of it.

## Teardown

Delete every fixture actor and the items the storage and money steps created.
Confirm `storedItems(location)` is empty before the location goes. The
initiative step also leaves a combat, a scene with tokens, and the chat messages
both settings produced — delete all three, and issue the scene delete WITHOUT
awaiting it (awaiting a viewed scene's deletion hangs the headless driver).
