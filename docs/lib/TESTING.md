# Lib — live-test recipe

Format per docs-doctrine: fixtures → steps → observable → teardown. Server and
driver mechanics are `C:\Proj\acks-rules\TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md`.

`lib` is the shared surface every other feature reads, so a break here shows up
as ten features breaking. Walk this recipe before the others when several
report the same symptom.

## Fixtures

- Disposable `acks-extras.animal`, `acks-extras.group` and
  `acks-extras.template` actors.
- A disposable `acks-extras.location` actor (a storage provider).
- A disposable `character` and a `monster` to put inside them.

## Core drive mechanics (non-obvious, learned live)

- **Sub-types need a world relaunch, not an F5** — `.claude/rules/live-testing.md`
  has the whole rule. Check `game.documentTypes.Actor` before concluding a
  model failed to register.
- **`storage.stash(source, provider, spec)` — the place is the SECOND
  argument**, and `spec` is an array of `{id, qty}`, not documents.
  `retrieve(provider, target, spec)` reverses it. Passing documents where a
  spec belongs returns `{ok: false}` with no throw.
- **Coin `cv` is the COPPER value.** A gold piece is `cv: 100`. Minting with
  `cv: 1` produces items that look right on the sheet and are worth a
  hundredth of what the test expects — every downstream spend then reports
  `insufficientGold` and the bug looks like it is in the spender.
- Mint coin with `money.creditCoin(holder, [{name, cv, count}])` — an ARRAY.
  A bare object is not iterable and throws `credits is not iterable`.
- Hand-creating a `money` item instead is not equivalent: `coinSlots` reads
  `system.coppervalue`, which `creditCoin` sets and a hand-made item does not.
- **A storage round-trip RE-CREATES the item, so a remembered item id is stale
  afterwards.** `stash` then `retrieve` returns an item with a new `_id`;
  `actor.items.get(oldId)` is undefined and every call taking that item then
  reports "missing". Re-fetch by name after any transfer.
- **A group's occupants are `system.stacks`, not a count**, and they are added
  by DROPPING an actor on the group sheet.
- `bracketRow(rows, value)` returns **null** off the end of a table rather
  than clamping to the last row. Every ladder in the family reads through it,
  so assert the null.

## Steps

1. Sub-types: create one actor of each lib type.
   *Observable:* `game.documentTypes.Actor` lists all three, each creates, and
   each opens its own sheet (`GroupSheet`, `TemplateSheet`; an animal opens
   the monsters feature's `FullMonsterSheet`).
2. Groups: drop a monster on the group sheet.
   *Observable:* a stack row appears naming it, with a headcount and the
   Individuate / Record casualties controls; `system.stacks` holds it.
3. Templates: import a table into the template and materialize it.
   *Observable:* the sheet stops saying it has no materialized tables and
   generates a document from them.
4. Storage: `stash(character, location, [{id, qty}])` then
   `retrieve(location, character, [{id, qty}])`.
   *Observable:* both return `{ok: true}` with a manifest; the item moves off
   the character's sheet and back, and `storedItems(location)` tracks it.
   `ownerOf` returns the stamping actor on the way in and attribution is
   dropped on the way out.
5. Money: `creditCoin(actor, [{name: "Gold", cv: 100, count: 500}])`, then
   `planCoinSpend` for an amount needing change.
   *Observable:* `coinSlots` reports `cv: 100, qty: 500`; the plan takes
   smallest-first and books the overshoot as change, and a spend it cannot
   cover plans nothing rather than part-paying.
6. Tables: `tables.registerTable({id, rows}, {source})` a ladder — the
   document must carry its own `id` or registration throws — read it with
   `bracketRow` inside and outside its bands, then
   `unregisterTable(id, source)`.
   *Observable:* in-band rows resolve, out-of-band returns null, and the
   deregistered table is gone from `hasDoc`.
7. Attack patch: with the `attackRollPatch` setting on, roll an attack.
   *Observable:* the patched path runs; turn the setting off and the system's
   own path returns. An inert setting is a bug.
8. Vision and senses: with `manageVision` on, place a token of an actor with a
   declared lightless range.
   *Observable:* the token's vision matches `senses.sightRange`, and the
   "Migrate Token Vision" macro re-derives it for tokens already placed.
9. Follower card: open a plain `monster`.
   *Observable:* `FollowerCardSheet` renders as the compact card, and its
   **Full sheet** control (`data-action="fcOpenFull"`) opens `FullMonsterSheet`
   beside it.

## Teardown

Delete every fixture actor and the items the storage and money steps created.
Confirm `storedItems(location)` is empty before the location goes.
