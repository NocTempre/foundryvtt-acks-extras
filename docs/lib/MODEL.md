# Library — Design Model

acks-lib is the family's shared-primitives library (`library: true`). It ships
**no sheets and no world data** — it exposes vocabulary + DataModel field-
builders that consumer modules assemble into their own models.

- **Reuse**: the `acks` system's damage/save vocabulary and (via the core-
  deferral shim `game.acks?.lib`) any surface later upstreamed into core.
- **Extend**: the shared ACKS effect/ability vocabulary (`scripts/vocab.mjs`)
  and its DataModel field-builders (`scripts/fields.mjs`) — the target both
  acks-abilities and (deferred) acks-monsters build their models from.
- **Enhance**: nothing yet — the FAMILY.md §3 plumbing (tables registry, socket
  relay, effects collector, economy data) is deliberately **out of v0.1 scope**
  and remains the family-refactor Phase 1 backlog.
- **Invent**: `LevelValue` — the level-scaling value type + its resolver — the
  one genuinely new primitive, spanning thief skills, per-level throws, and
  attack/save progressions.

## Perception: senses, light, and the token

Three files answer "what can this creature see, and how brightly does it burn?"
for every actor in the family — a lone monster, a party member, a detached
scout. They live here rather than in a feature because more than one asks.

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `scripts/senses.mjs` | Reading ACKS senses off the sheet, and translating them into Foundry sight. |
| `scripts/light.mjs` | The RR light table, and which record holds a given actor's lights. |
| `scripts/token-sync.mjs` | The two guarded writes that put either on a token. |

**Sense resolution** runs in one precedence order, so the movement rules and the
canvas can never disagree: the Full Monster Sheet stat block
(`flags["acks-extras"].extras`), then a `kw:lightlessvision` capability, then
item and active-effect names. `canSeeInDark` (the ⅓-speed blinded rule) and
`senseProfile` (token sight) are two readings of that one answer.

**The Foundry mapping.** `sight.range` is what a token sees *in darkness* — core
derives `basicSight` at that range and `lightPerception` at infinity
(`client/documents/token.mjs:541`), so range 0 means "sees only what is lit",
which is the correct and common answer for a human. Detection modes are left
alone entirely, since core derives them from `sight`.

| ACKS | `sight.range` | `visionMode` |
|---|---|---|
| Ordinary eyes | 0 | `basic` |
| Lightless Vision | its recorded range (MM default 60') | `monochromatic` |
| Shadowy senses | 30' | `monochromatic` |
| Echolocation / mechanoreception | its recorded range | `monochromatic` |
| Blind | its best sense range, else 30' | `monochromatic` |
| Night Vision | 0 | `lightAmplification` |

**Light ownership is exclusive.** An actor in a formation takes its lights from
that formation's record (which tracks fuel, shutters and burn-down); only an
actor in no formation reads its own `flags["acks-extras"].lights`. Reading both
would let a member carry two contradictory torches. lib asks the formation
through `globalThis.acksExtras.formation.lightsForBearer`, which returns `null`
— not `[]` — for a non-member, because that is the difference between "carrying
nothing" and "not a member".

**Overrides are respected, differently for each write.** A light is only ever
cleared if we set it (`managedLight`). Vision cannot be that shy — the whole
point is to overwrite the system's stock `sight.range: 60` on every monster — so
it stamps what it wrote (`managedVision`) and compares before writing again; a
token whose sight no longer matches the stamp was edited by a human and is
handed back permanently. `manageVision` is the world-level off switch.
